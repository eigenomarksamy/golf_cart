# # Visual Odometry for Localization in Autonomous Driving
# 
# Welcome to the assignment for Module 2: Visual Features - Detection, Description and Matching. In this assignment, you will practice using the material you have learned to estimate an autonomous vehicle trajectory by images taken with a monocular camera set up on the vehicle.
# 
# 
# **In this assignment, you will:**
# - Extract  features from the photographs  taken with a camera setup on the vehicle.
# - Use the extracted features to find matches between the features in different photographs.
# - Use the found matches to estimate the camera motion between subsequent photographs. 
# - Use the estimated camera motion to build the vehicle trajectory.
# 
# For most exercises, you are provided with a suggested outline. You are encouraged to diverge from the outline if you think there is a better, more efficient way to solve a problem.
# 
# You are only allowed to use the packages loaded bellow and the custom functions explained in the notebook. Run the cell bellow to import the required packages:

# ## 0 - Loading and Visualizing the Data
# We provide you with a convenient dataset handler class to read and iterate through samples taken from the CARLA simulator. Run the following code to create a dataset handler object. 

# In[2]:


dataset_handler = DatasetHandler()


# The dataset handler contains 52 data frames. Each frame contains an RGB image and a depth map taken with a setup on the vehicle and a grayscale version of the RGB image which will be used for computation. Furthermore, camera calibration matrix K is also provided in the dataset handler.
# 
# Upon creation of the dataset handler object, all the frames will be automatically read and loaded. The frame content can be accessed by using `images`, `images_rgb`, `depth_maps` attributes of the dataset handler object along with the index of the requested frame. See how to access the images (grayscale), rgb images (3-channel color), depth maps and camera calibration matrix in the example below.
# 
# **Note (Depth Maps)**: Maximum depth distance is 1000. This value of depth shows that the selected pixel is at least 1000m (1km) far from the camera, however the exact distance of this pixel from the camera is unknown. Having this kind of points in further trajectory estimation might affect the trajectory precision.

# ## 1 - Feature Extraction
# 
# ### 1.1 - Extracting Features from an Image
# 
# **Task**: Implement feature extraction from a single image. You can use any feature descriptor of your choice covered in the lectures, ORB for example. 
# 
# 
# Note 1: Make sure you understand the structure of the keypoint descriptor object, this will be very useful for your further tasks. You might find [OpenCV: Keypoint Class Description](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.3/d2/d29/classcv_1_1KeyPoint.html) handy.
# 
# Note 2: Make sure you understand the image coordinate system, namely the origin location and axis directions.
# 
# Note 3: We provide you with a function to visualise the features detected. Run the last 2 cells in section 1.1 to view.
# 
# ***Optional***: Try to extract features with different descriptors such as SIFT, ORB, SURF and BRIEF. You can also try using detectors such as Harris corners or FAST and pairing them with a descriptor. Lastly, try changing parameters of the algorithms. Do you see the difference in various approaches?
# You might find this link useful:  [OpenCV:Feature Detection and Description](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.3/db/d27/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_feature2d.html).

# ## 3 - Trajectory Estimation
# 
# At this point you have everything to perform visual odometry for the autonomous vehicle. In this section you will incrementally estimate the pose of the vehicle by examining the changes that motion induces on the images of its onboard camera.
# 
# ### 3.1 - Estimating Camera Motion between a Pair of Images
# 
# **Task**: Implement camera motion estimation from a pair of images. You can use the motion estimation algorithm covered in the lecture materials, namely Perspective-n-Point (PnP), as well as Essential Matrix Decomposition.
# 
# - If you decide to use PnP, you will need depth maps of frame and they are provided with the dataset handler. Check out Section 0 of this assignment to recall how to access them if you need. As this method has been covered in the course, review the lecture materials if need be.
# - If you decide to use Essential Matrix Decomposition, more information about this method can be found in [Wikipedia: Determining R and t from E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_matrix).
# 
# More information on both approaches implementation can be found in [OpenCV: Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.3/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html). Specifically, you might be interested in _Detailed Description_ section of [OpenCV: Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.3/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html) as it explains the connection between the 3D world coordinate system and the 2D image coordinate system.
# 
# 
# ***Optional***: Implement camera motion estimation with PnP, PnP with RANSAC and Essential Matrix Decomposition. Check out how filtering matches by distance changes estimated camera movement. Do you see the difference in various approaches?

# Please run the cell bellow, then copy its output to the provided yaml file for submission on the programming assignment page.
# 
# **Expected Submission Format**:
# 
# ```
# Trajectory X:
#  [[  0.          locX1        locX2        ...   ]]
# Trajectory Y:
#  [[  0.          locY1        locY2        ...   ]]
# Trajectory Z:
#  [[  0.          locZ1        locZ2        ...   ]]
# ```
#  
#  In this output: locX1, locY1, locZ1; locX2, locY2, locZ2; ... are the coordinates of the corresponding 1st, 2nd and etc. camera locations

# ### Visualize your Results
# 
# **Important**:
# 
# 1) Make sure your results visualization is appealing before submitting your results. You might want to download this project dataset and check whether the trajectory that you have estimated is consistent to the one that you see from the dataset frames. 
# 
# 2) Assure that your trajectory axis directions follow the ones in _Detailed Description_ section of [OpenCV: Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.3/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html).
